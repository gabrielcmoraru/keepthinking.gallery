This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can try the live version -> [LIVE](https://gabrielcmoraru.github.io/keepthinking.gallery/).

To run the project localy:

  * Make sure you have NODE and NPM installed ( of course you do ! )
  * Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start the local development server with `npm start` from you terminal
  * Or just run `npm run build` and you can start a local server run by running `serve -s build` directly from the app directory and then open the browser at localhost:5000 OR => from the build folder of the project with `python -m http.server` assuming you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
  * Did you say you want to put this on github pages? sure thing `npm run deploy` but before that make sure you make the necessary amendments you can find a very detailed step by step [here](https://codeburst.io/deploy-react-to-github-pages-to-create-an-amazing-website-42d8b09cd4d)
